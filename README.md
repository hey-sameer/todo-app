This application will function similarly to a task manager, allowing the user to enter the tasks that they need to complete. They can also remove themselves from the list once they have completed their tasks.

It is a single activity multiple screen app where instead of fragments and nav-graphs it used compose navigation. to It offers a animated splash screen, user-authentication using Google Firebase(OneTap Signin). Besides simple crud functionality on tasks created, you can set priority levels to each task and sort them based on it. It also offers a search feature and swipe-to-delete. It also has dark mode.

Technology used: Kotlin, Compose UI Toolkit, Compose Navigation, Room Database, Dagger-Hilt
